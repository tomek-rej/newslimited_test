USAGE

First run the fetch_tags.py script:
    python fetch_data.py

Then start up the nodejs server:
    nodejs display_tags.js

Then go to http://localhost:8000

Listed at the top you will find a table of tags and their links.
Below is a list of commits and links to the Github url.


I made an assumption that the link should take the user to the github page of the tag.
By default the github api seems to return the tarball or zipball url.
